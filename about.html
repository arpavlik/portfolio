                Hi! I'm Aimee Pavlik. Here's a look into who I am, what I do, blah
                blah blah . . .

                The first spark of interest in tech was actually when I was in middle school. I had a Tumblr page and I got really into my blog, posting what I now deem to be pubicly embarrassing but 
                secretly nostalgic and cute fan edits and stories. I wanted to further customize my page and ended up learning about custom Tumblr themes, and that anyone could do it. This began 
                my journey first into HTML/CSS, and then eventually into JavaScript.

                Learning just enough to accomplish what I wanted my blog to look like, I realized I like being able to move around the elements on the page and really have a say in how my content was 
                organized. This led me to doing some online tutorials, but it still felt like I was only learning the specific of what I wanted to do - I wasn't gaining a general under standing.
